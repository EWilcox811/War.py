# Card game War simulation
The first program simply simulates the game of war between two computer players.
Each player is dealt half of a 52 card deck. Each card has a suit a rank and a value.
Each player plays cards one at a time and the player with the more "powerful" card wins
the round and receives both there card and their opponents card.  If cards are of 
equivalent value, then a "war" occurs. When a war occurs each player pulls out 5 more
cards and then flips a sixth to compare again.  The player with the sixth card of higher
value then receives all cards associated with that war.  When one player runs out of cards
or is unable to do a war because they don't have enough cards, the game is over and the player 
with all the cards is declared the winner.

# BlackJack Card Game
The second program is a game of blackjack between a user player and an automated dealer.
The player has the option to stand or to hit and the choice of the amount that they would like
to bet.  The program keeps track of the player's total money and alerts the player of wins, losses, 
busts and blackjacks!
