# Card game War simulation
This program simply simulates the game of war between to computer players.
Each player is dealt half of a 52 card deck. Each card has a suit a rank and a value.
Each player plays cards one at a time and the player with the more "powerful" card wins
the round and receives both there card and their opponents card.  If cards are of 
equivalent value, then a "war" occurs. When a war occurs each player pulls out three more
cards and then flip a fourth to compare again.  The player with the fourth card of higher
value then receives all cards associated with that war.  When one player runs out of cards
the game is over and the player with all the cards is declared the winner.
